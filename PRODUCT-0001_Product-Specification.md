## 1. Identity

This document is an admitted product of the Sandboxed Production Ecology.

It defines the minimal conditions under which any artefact may be admitted as a product within the ecology, including itself.

This specification is authoritative until revised under the rules it declares.

## 2. Definition of a Product

A product is a structured, durable artefact that:

- is explicitly admitted to the ecology,
- persists independently of the agent(s) that produced it,
- may be revised but not replaced,
- carries provenance and revision history,
- may circulate beyond the ecology through governed channels,
- may serve as an input to other products.

Artefacts that are not admitted are not products of the ecology.

## 3. Required Properties of All Products

Every admitted product must have, at minimum:

- a unique identifier,
- a declared scope,
- a declared status,
- an explicit admission event,
- a revision history,
- an owning authority within the ecology.

If any of these properties are absent, the artefact is not a valid product.

- admission,
- revision,

- deprecation.

Replacement, erasure, or substitution of an admitted product is not permitted.

Disputes regarding scope, authority, or validity are resolved internally according to declared governance rules, as revised over time.

## 6. Self-Application
