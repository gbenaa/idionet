# Product 0001 — Product Specification and Admission Protocol

**Version:** 0.1  
**Status:** Admitted  
**Authority:** Sandboxed Production Ecology  
**Revision mode:** Constitutional change only

---

## Purpose

This product defines what counts as a product within the Sandboxed Production Ecology.

It specifies product standing, admission, registration, revision, authority, violation handling, boundary conditions, and constitutional change.

This specification formalises governance that was exercised in practice prior to its admission.

It does not retroactively govern past actions and does not invalidate previously admitted products.

---

## Bootstrap Statement

Governance within the ecology was operationally enforced before this specification existed as an admitted product.

This document is admitted post hoc to stabilise, render inspectable, and bind rules already demonstrated in operation.

This condition is preserved as provenance and does not constitute a general precedent.

---

## Scope

This specification governs all products admitted after its admission date.

Previously admitted products retain their standing.

---

## Authority

Authority resides exclusively within the Sandboxed Production Ecology.

This specification is self-governing from the moment of admission.

---

## Constitutional Constraint

Changes to this product constitute constitutional change and must be explicitly declared as such.
