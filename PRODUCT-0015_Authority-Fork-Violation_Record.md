# Product 0015 — Authority Fork Violation Record (Second Register Attempt)

**Version:** 0.1  
**Status:** Admitted  
**Authority:** Sandboxed Production Ecology  
**Governing specification:** Product 0001 v0.1  
**Related primitive:** Product 0005 v0.2  
**Revision mode:** Revision-only (no replacement)

---

## Purpose

To record a deliberate attempt to fork authority by creating a second product register artefact.

---

## Violation

- **Invalid artefact:** PRODUCT-0014_Forked-Product-Register.md
- **Violating commit:** eedd1403e568132ef6d74752aaaab4fac00c0b73
- **Violation type:** Attempted creation of a second product register

---

## Rule

There must be exactly one canonical Product Register within the ecology.

No second register may have standing as a product register, whether or not it is admitted.

---

## Disposition

- PRODUCT-0014 is declared invalid as a register and must not be treated as authoritative.
- If PRODUCT-0014 is later admitted as a product, it may only exist as a historical record of the violation, not as a register.
- Authority remains solely with Product 0002.
