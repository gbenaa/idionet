# Product 0004 — Self-Binding Governance Constraint

**Version:** 0.1  
**Status:** Admitted  
**Authority:** Sandboxed Production Ecology  
**Governing specification:** Product 0001 v0.1  
**Revision mode:** Revision-only (no replacement)

---

## Purpose

This product establishes a governance constraint that binds the founding authority of the Sandboxed Production Ecology.

Its function is to ensure that no artefact may function as a product without explicit admission and registration.

---

## Constraint

The founding authority may not:

- treat any artefact as a product unless it has been explicitly admitted,
- reference an artefact as authoritative unless it is recorded in the Product Register,
- circulate or build upon undeclared artefacts as if they were products.

Artefacts created outside the ecology remain drafts and have no standing.

---

## Enforcement

Violation of this constraint invalidates the artefact in question as a product of the ecology.

Correction occurs only by:
- subsequent admission as a new product, or
- explicit deprecation of the invalid artefact.

---

## Scope

This constraint applies to:
- documents,
- data files,
- software artefacts,
- media outputs,
- governance texts,
- and any other durable outputs intended to persist.

---

## Self-Application

This governance constraint applies to the founding authority itself.

Any change to this constraint must occur as a revision to this product.
